Welcome to Fort Rose my personal haven for lunacy, idiotic thoughts and ramblings, I am your host
AbdEl-Rahman Tarek Ahmed Ahmed Ali, a long name but one I adore dearly.
I'm  what you can call a solipsistic adolescent, I graduated from the Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University :3
and I have no idea what to say next.

I like teaching, software engineering, writing stories and doing idiotic stuff to people. 
Amongst my few hobbies is making fan content for games. I made the notorious Minecraft mods
Thaumic Warden, Mankini and the never relased Wanderer. I also make the "GWENT Lazy Bot".

I aspire to be a Game Dev and am currently working on jRose my own Java 2D Game Dev Framework intended for beginners
and hopefully will be start of my tutorials and my plan of mass world domination.
